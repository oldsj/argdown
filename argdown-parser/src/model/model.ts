/**
 * All data objects stored in the [[IArgdownResponse]] are simple object literals implementing an interface.
 * You can simply instantiate an argument, statement or relation by creating an object literal and adding properties to it.
 *
 * To support runtime type checking, each of these objects has a required `obj.type` property with its own ArgdownTypes member as type.
 * Typescript will automatically narrow the type if you check if some object's type property is equal to a specific ArgdownTypes member.
 *
 * @example
 * ```javascript
 * // Instantiate a new statement by using an object literal:
 * const obj = {
 *  type: ArgdownTypes.STATEMENT,
 *  title: "Some title",
 *  text: "Some text"
 * }
 *
 * if(obj.type === ArgdownTypes.STATEMENT){
 *  // Because IStatement is the only type with ArgdownTypes.STATEMENT as type of its `type`property
 *  // Typescript will now know that obj is of type IStatement, you don't have to cast it explicitely.
 *  obj.tags = ["some tag"];
 *  obj.role = StatementRole.PREMISE;
 * }
 * ```
